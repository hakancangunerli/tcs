welcome.

the structure is quite easy to follow. i will try to be as serious as i can, and you do the sample projects as much as you can, then criss-cross. Ã¼



unlike many languages you have heard of or have seen, python is quite human-readable. 

here is an example of how LONG a hello world is in other languages, 

in java;


public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}
