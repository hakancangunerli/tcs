pygame is an interesting module of python that aims to help people create simple projects, and is community driven. 

there has not been a full-on indie game designed in pygame, but it is hoped that many people will be able to implement small projects using so.

there's cool tutorials in its main website, https://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials, but as I've said it is community driven and so you'd have to dig a little bit to find the good stuff.

its set functions could be found here;
